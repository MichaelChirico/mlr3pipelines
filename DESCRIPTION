Title: Composable Preprocessing Operators and Pipelines with mlr
Description: Toolset that enriches mlr with a diverse set of preprocessing
    operators. Composable Preprocessing Operators ("CPO"s) are first-class
    R objects that can be applied to data.frames and mlr "Task"s to modify
    data, can be attached to mlr "Learner"s to add preprocessing to machine
    learning algorithms, and can be composed to form preprocessing pipelines.
