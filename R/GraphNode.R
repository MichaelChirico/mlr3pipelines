#' @description
#' The \code{GraphNode} class implements behaviors required to define the
#' connections between the \code{PipeOps}. The set of interconnected
#' GraphNodes creates the pipeline graph.
#'
#' @section Public Members / Active Bindings:
#' * `graph`                :: [Graph]
#'   Graph that this node is a member of.
#' * `pipeop`               :: [PipeOp]
#'   Contained PipeOp.
#' * `prev_node_channels`   :: list of [NodeChannel]
#'   Identifies the channels from previous nodes that we are connected to.
#'   Mutation can be used to change connections.
#' * `next_node_channels`   :: list of [NodeChannel]
#'   Identifies the channels from successor nodes that we are connected to.
#'   Mutation can be used to change connections.
#' * `next_nodes`           :: list of [GraphNode]
#'   Successor nodes, indexed by channel_id.
