#' @title PipeOpImputeMode
#'
#' @usage NULL
#' @name mlr_pipeops_imputemode
#' @format [`R6Class`] object inheriting from [`PipeOpImpute`]/[`PipeOp`].
#'
#' @description
#' Impute features by their mode. Supports factors as well as logical and numerical features.
#'
#' @section Construction:
#' ```
#' PipeOpImputeMode$new(id = "imputemode", param_vals = list())
#' ```
#'
#' * `id` :: `character(1)`\cr
#'   Identifier of resulting object, default `"imputemode"`.
#' * `param_vals` :: named `list`\cr
#'   List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default `list()`.
#'
#' @section Input and Output Channels:
#' Input and output channels are inherited from [`PipeOpImpute`].
#'
#' The output is the input [`Task`][mlr3::Task] with all affected features missing values imputed by (column-wise) mode.
#'
#' @section State:
#' The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from [`PipeOpImpute`].
#'
#' The `$state$model` is a named `list` of a vector of length one of the type of the feature, indicating the mode of the respective feature.
#'
#' @section Parameters:
#' The parameters are the parameters inherited from [`PipeOpImpute`], as well as the following parameters based on [`compute_mode()`][mlr3misc::compute_mode]:
#' * `ties_method` :: `character(1)`\cr
#'   Ties handling type. One of \dQuote{random} (default), \dQuote{first} or \dQuote{last}.
#'
#' @section Internals:
#' Uses the [`mlr3misc::compute_mode()`] function. Features that are entirely `NA` are imputed as the following:
#' For factors (also ordered factors) a random factor level is sampled. Numerics and integers are imputed as `0`.
#' For logicals, `TRUE` or `FALSE` is sampled.
#'
#' @section Methods:
#' Only methods inherited from [`PipeOpImpute`]/[`PipeOp`].
