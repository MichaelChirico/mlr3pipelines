# class Graph
# members:
#   source_node
# 
# methods
# - index operator [[id]]  --> points to GraphNode 
#   FIXME: Should this point to the GraphNode or to the PipeOp
# 
# active bindings:
#   - is_learnt [logical].  Are all underlying operators trained?
#   - parset [ParamSet]. Returns flat ParamSet, names are pipeOpid:parid, it is computed on the fly.
#   - parvals [list]. Set param vals, name scheme as above, passed them down to pipeOps via id.
#   - ids [character]. Id's of PipeOp's in the graph.
# 
# questions:
#   - does index op also work with ints?
#   - do we want the fourth layer of topological sorting?
#   - how do we loops over all nodes? how do we apply something to all nodes?
