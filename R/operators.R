#' @title PipeOp Composition Operator
#'
#' @description
#' This operator \dQuote{pipes} data from the source `g1` into the sink `g2`. Both source and sink can either be
#' a [`Graph`] or a [`PipeOp`]. The number of output channels of `g1` (as given by `g1$output`) must equal the
#' number of input channels of `g2` (as given by `g2$input`). Connections between channels are created in the
#' order in which they occur in `g1` and `g2`, respectively: `g1`'s output channel 1 is connected to `g2`'s input
#' channel 1, channel 2 to 2 etc.
#'
#' This operator always created deep copies of its input arguments, so they cannot be modified by reference.
#' To access individual `PipeOp`s after composition, use the resulting `Graph`'s `$pipeops` list.
#'
#'
#' @param g1 ([`Graph`] | [`PipeOp`]) \cr
#'   `Graph` / `PipeOp` to put in front of `g2`.
#' @param g2 ([`Graph`] | [`PipeOp`]) \cr
#'   `Graph` / `PipeOp` to put after  `g1`.

#' o1 = PipeOpScale$new()

#' # The following two are equivalent:
#' result1 = o1 %>>% o2
#'
#' result2 = Graph$new()$
#'   add_pipeop(o1$copy(deep = TRUE))$
#'   add_pipeop(o2$copy(deep = TRUE))$
#'   add_edge(o1$id, o2$id)
