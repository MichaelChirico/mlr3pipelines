#' @title Union of graphs

#' @description
#' Takes an arbitrary amount of [Graph]s and/or [PipeOp]s as inputs and joins
#' them by "stacking" them one over the other.
#' Returns the full graph.

#' @param graphs A list of [Graph] or [PipeOp] \cr
#'   List of elements with one of the types defined above, which are the
#'   graphs to be joined.
